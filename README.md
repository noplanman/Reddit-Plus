# Reddit Plus

Reddit Plus is a userscript for Reddit that adds additional features to simplify your Reddit life.

It's a work in progress, adding features as I go. Feel free to join in and add useful features, making Reddit Plus the ultimate userscript for Reddit.

You can safely use it in addition to the [Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement) if you have that installed too.

## Features

Here's a list of currently available features:
- [Comments toggle](#comments-toggle): Load comments with 1 click

---

### Comments toggle
If you are an active Redittor you will know what it's like, having to open a post only to read a handful of comments. *What a drag...*

With the comments toggle it's now possible to open comments in the list view with just 1 click, loading them right beneath the post. In the same way that you can easily expand the description text of a post you can now load the comments.
In this added view, you can vote, write a new comment and reply to any existing comments, just like that. If you want to stay up to date with the new comments being added, simply **reload comments** with a single click

*Next to each* **`comment(s)`** *link of each post in a list view, you can now find a little* **`[+]`** *button, give it a go!*

*Easily write a new comment by clicking the* **`add new comment`** *button.*

***There is still 1 known issue with this feature at the moment:***
- When voting on a post with the comments opened, it looks as if all comments have been voted on too (vote button turned orange), but that is NOT the case, it's just a visual change, not an actual vote. This is due to the way that Reddit handles voting and I can't do anything about it just yet.
